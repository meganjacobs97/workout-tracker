# Workout Tracker

## A fullstack application that allows you to create and update workouts.

This application makes use of a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express. The front end is built using jQuery and handlebars. If I come back to this project in the future, the UI could definitely use some styling improvements. 

## Installation 

To modify the code to suit your purposes, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The application is set up to use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) when running on your local machine. You will have to install if you have not done so. 

The following npm packages must also be installed, which you can do by running `npm install` from your termninal: 
* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars)
* [Express Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [@handlebars/allow-prototype-access](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@handlebars/allow-prototype-access)
* [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
* [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
